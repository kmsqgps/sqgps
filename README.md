# Navixy
Hello and welcome to the Navixy repository! Here you will find only one script, but more to follow!

## Navixy Standalone Checker
The script here called "checker.sh" is a simple script created to assist our clients with basic troubleshooting of their Standalone system. Once downloaded, you will need to run:
```
chmod +x checker.sh

```
in order to allow the file to run on the system, and:
```
./checker.sh
```
to run it. 

Within the script, we have the hostname as "localhost" however if you wish to use another option, please edit that within the file.
